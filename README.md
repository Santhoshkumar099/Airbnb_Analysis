Airbnb Analysis Project
Introduction
This project aims to analyze Airbnb listings data using various Python libraries and tools. The main goals are to visualize data, gain insights, and create an interactive web application for exploring Airbnb data. The project utilizes the following tools:

Python: For data processing and analysis.
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
Plotly: For creating interactive plots.
PyGWalker: For easy and interactive data exploration.
Matplotlib: For additional plotting capabilities.
Features
Data Visualization: Interactive plots and maps to visualize Airbnb listings.
Interactive Web App: A Streamlit-based web application for exploring the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Tools for performing EDA on the Airbnb dataset.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airbnb-analysis.git
cd airbnb-analysis
Create a Virtual Environment

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should include:

Copy code
streamlit
plotly
pygwalker
matplotlib
pandas
numpy
Usage
Running the Streamlit App
Start the Streamlit App

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open the App in Your Browser

Streamlit will provide a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501). Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.

Exploring Data with PyGWalker
PyGWalker is integrated into the Streamlit app to provide an interactive data exploration interface. Within the Streamlit app, you'll find sections where you can use PyGWalker to explore and visualize the data.

Visualizations
The app includes various visualizations created using Plotly and Matplotlib:

Scatter Plots: Interactive maps showing Airbnb listings based on location.
Bar Charts: Distribution of listings based on price, room type, etc.
Histograms: Price distributions and other numerical data insights.
Box Plots: Analysis of price variations by neighborhood.
