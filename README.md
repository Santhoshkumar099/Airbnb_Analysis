# Airbnb Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze Airbnb listings data using various Python libraries and tools. The main goals are to visualize data, gain insights, and create an interactive web application for exploring Airbnb data. The project utilizes the following tools:

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive plots.
- **PyGWalker**: For easy and interactive data exploration.
- **Matplotlib**: For additional plotting capabilities.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive plots and maps to visualize Airbnb listings.
- **Interactive Web App**: A Streamlit-based web application for exploring the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Tools for performing EDA on the Airbnb dataset.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)






## Installation

pip install 

```bash
  streamlit
  plotly
  pygwalker
  matplotlib
  pandas
  numpy

```
## Exploring Data with PyGWalker

PyGWalker is integrated into the Streamlit app to provide an interactive data exploration interface. Within the Streamlit app, you'll find sections where you can use PyGWalker to explore and visualize the data.

## Visualizations
The app includes various visualizations created using Plotly and Matplotlib:

- **Scatter Plots:** Interactive maps showing Airbnb listings based on location.
- **Bar Charts:** Distribution of listings based on price, room type, etc.
- **Histograms:** Price distributions and other numerical data insights.
- **Box Plots:**:  Analysis of price variations by neighborhood.
